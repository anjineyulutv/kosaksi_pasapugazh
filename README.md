1.A way of running inclusive communities in colleges.

2.The idea has popped from movie 3 Idiots aka Nanban aka Snehithudu.

3.The core idea is to fill the gaps of academia to make student ready for the industry.

4.I truly believe in team collaboration can ensure that people don't burn quickly.

5.I truly believe college is a place to enjoy and make life long connections.But to ensure industry readiness,when including everyone on building a product people can put minimal effort,but still see the most rigorous and nuanced problems and able to cherish the depth and also get exposed to the rigour required to get the world going.

6.I believe the design would ensure that the top talent across universities being in diffrent phases of life who want to chill will still put minimal effort and ensure that they are aligning their goals for both their social and academic life.

Suggestion for redesign are welcome.Please raise a PR
