                                                                      Community Guidelines

1.Core committee is appointed to operate at scale.
2.Communities should be designed inclusive which diversify their ideas.
3.Core committee should be taking ideas at scale from the respective Organization or University and have a Idea Board where we can track interpolation and extrapolation of ideas.
4.Emphasis on ideas should be prominent than implementation.
5.Core committee should diversify their team with evaluators from persona of Management,Engineering,Product to validate ideas of feasibilty which mirrors efforts of current corporate world.
6.Core committee should follow capitalism to enable people in the community to be succesful in the corporate world.
7.Core committee should focus on frugal innvovation to distill ideas to achive minimal viable results.
8.Core committee should parallelize work for diversification of ideas to bring in minimal effort but maximum impact.
9.The KPI of the community success should be the percentage of inclusivity within the entity that can be accessed.
10.KPIs should be given greatest importance and should be changed often to ensure that inclusivity is being the top most priority.

I hope these guidelines can help in practice capitalism and keep the world democratic,ensure GDP grows quickly and finally increase Happiness Index of diffrent economies.
